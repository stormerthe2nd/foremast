A simple banking programme with python's Tkinter Module
I used sqlite3 for database management
Amidst my other projects I finally managed to finish this one
I created this when i was new to programming, so the code is too complicated to comprehend but it works
please let me know if you bump into any errors

* Download the zip
* Unzip the folder
* Double click App.py and this should start the program
* Create an account by hitting 'Create' and provide a name and a pin
* After creating an Account you'll have close the programme and rerun the app.py file
* Now your account is registered in the Database and so you can Login
* Access the Bank perfrom various actions as deposit, withdraw, etc and please let me know of any errors

Thank You So Much for your Time!!!!!!!!
